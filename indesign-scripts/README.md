Allows you to load a script in a .txt file and automatically input lines into text frames as they're being created (in a similar vein to Typesetterer). At the moment, it simply takes a text file and reads it line by line, so some prior formatting will be required to make it output properly.

### Usage
1) Run the script file inside InDesign
2) Select your text file.
3) Create a text frame and shape/place/format as you wish. DO NOT ENTER ANY TEXT as the text frame needs to be empty for this to work.
4) Press escape to exit the text editing function of the text frame. This will set the contents of the text frame to the currently selected item in the script list.

You can choose your starting point by selecting the required line in the script list.

This is an early version of the script, and changes will most likely be coming quicky in order to further flesh it out. It hasn't been tested that much, so I expect some bugs to happen while using it. Please contact me with any issues which may occur while using this script.
